# Status Report #7 - May 26th

## Team Report


### Plans and goals from last week

*   Agenda for Thursday project meeting
    *   Address next week's assignment: Peer Review
        *   We should especially careful this week to keep our master branch clean and building properly, as others will be interacting with it and downloading Spark at unknown times.
    *   We have 12 days until our final release. What is most important for us to focus on?
        *   Playback and recording integration
        *   Playback and file system refinement
        *   
    *   Address Final Release assignment
    *   Mark: How are you? Where are you? Caught up? Questions?
    *   ...
*   Complete audio playback thumbnail
*   Integrate project management components
*   Integrate playback and recording functionality
    *   Very important to complete prior to final release
    *   Without this, Spark doesn't serve its purpose
*   Finish up the playback function by integrating Jay's version (almost done)
    *   Clean up the code of Jay's playback thumbnail component 
*   Finish the thumbnail for the file system (mostly done)
*   Finish documentation for audio recorder
*   Fix some of the issues we have
*   Add a more substantial testing suite
    *   Get everyone up to speed with adding and running test

### Progress and issues

*   Project management 
    *   Allows for easier handling of projects by other components
    *   A project consists of...
        *   A singular mixdown
        *   A collection of layers
*   ...

## Contributions


### Nolan Strait

*   Plans and goals from last week
    *   Playback thumbnail integration
        *   Aid Tuan in completion
    *   Integrate project management components
        *   Once playback thumbnail is complete
    *   Tie in playback and recording components
        *   This I anticipate being a challenge
        *   I'm hoping the project management components can make this job easier
    *   Update user documentation as necessary
    *   If time permits, look into fixing [issue #2: Audio input silent when multiple inputs are selected](https://github.com/nlstrait/Spark/issues/2)
        *   This is not crucial; one input works just fine
*   Progress and issues
    *   Did not aid in developing playback thumbnail
    *   Project management components integrated and expanded!
    *   Playback and recording component integration is nearly complete
        *   What's working: recording is now specific to a project, and layers are saved in an intuitive structure accordingly
        *   What's not working: if you begin recording in the middle of playback, the resulting recording isn't very useful; it doesn't have any filler at the start so that importing into a DAW project is easy.
    *   Did not attend to non-urgent issue #2 (linked above).
    *   Found large problems with the synchronization issues.
    *   The latest pull request has still not been able to be accepted to this problem.
*   Plans and goals for following week
    *   Continue performing extensive user tests.
    *   Hammer out any remaining issues with recording as-is.
    *   Add filler to beginning of layers which started recording in the middle of playback.
    *   Ensure that multiple, separate layers record while looping.
    *   Ensure that recording and transport functions operate cooperatively and intuitively.
    *   Integrate recording w/ new playback (after completed by Tuan and Jay).
    *   Make sure that we have a viable file structure view.
    *   Waveform slider upgrade must be finished.
    *   Make sure that we don't have synchronization issues.
    *   Add more test cases.

### Tuan Thai

*   Plans and goals from last week
    *   Finish up Jay's part by end of Thursday and commit so Nolan can start on his part.
    *   Implement the thumbnail
    *   Write more test cases
*   Progress and issues
    *   Talked a lot about our vision and priorities.
    *   Implemented the slider and we are thinking of an upgrade.
    *   Thumbnail is also implemented.
    *   Huge problem with the slider found with synchronous message handler.
    *   Possibly we can fix this with a detailed code review Thursday or Friday.
*   Plans and goals for following week
    *   Fix the slider and finish the upgrade.
    *   Implement our new file structure view.
    *   Have these two finished by Sunday and work through Monday/Tuesday to unify with Nolan.
