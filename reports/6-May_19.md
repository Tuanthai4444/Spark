# Status Report #6 - May 19th

## Team Report


### Plans and goals from last week

*   Agenda for Thursday project meeting
    *   Review next week's assignment: [Implementation and Documentation](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rjust/courses/2021Spring/CSE403/project/project07.html)
*   Get Mark up to speed
*   (Individual plans were clear but "team plans" were less so. The Team Report section of our report was not filled out.)


### Progress and issues

*   Implemented simple project management components (to be integrated)
*   Documentation
    *   Created [Spark User Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uvdGcDdwmmioiQLi-uWVZDDIGqzRN33mTG3bzXqQsGM/edit?userstoinvite=tuanthai401@gmail.com&ts=60a424d7)
    *   Added documentation to header files for several components
    *   Added documentation for building and testing processes
*   Did not close any previously documented issues
*   Got Mark (relatively) up-to-speed
*   Tuan had difficulty understanding code and took a while to fix the playback scroller.
*   We need to create some minor mocks for our testing
*   Successfully got cmake compilation to work using FRUT
*   Rewrote github actions build workflow to run using FRUT and cmake
*   Successfully created a working testing environment using juce::UnitTest
*   Succesfully automated testing on github actions

### Plans and goals for following week

*   Agenda for Thursday project meeting
    *   Address next week's assignment: Peer Review
        *   We should especially careful this week to keep our master branch clean and building properly, as others will be interacting with it and downloading Spark at unknown times.
    *   We have 12 days until our final release. What is most important for us to focus on?
        *   Playback and recording integration
        *   Playback and file system refinement
        *   
    *   Address Final Release assignment
    *   Mark: How are you? Where are you? Caught up? Questions?
    *   ...
*   Complete audio playback thumbnail
*   Integrate project management components
*   Integrate playback and recording functionality
    *   Very important to complete prior to final release
    *   Without this, Spark doesn't serve its purpose
*   Finish up the playback function by integrating Jay's version (almost done)
    *   Clean up the code of Jay's playback thumbnail component 
*   Finish the thumbnail for the file system (mostly done)
*   Finish documentation for audio recorder
*   Fix some of the issues we have
*   Add a more substantial testing suite
    *   Get everyone up to speed with adding and running tests

## Contributions


### Nolan Strait

*   Plans and goals from last week
    *   Implement components for project management
        *   Encapsulate mixdowns and layers in a project
        *   Ease communication between separate components which are both working on projects
        *   Enable easier project management outside of Spark
    *   Improve existing documentation and create new documents with aim of making them as useful and intuitive as possible
    *   Perform code reviews
    *   Addressing existing issues via GitHub Issues
        *   To be specified... 
*   Progress and issues
    *   Implemented project management components
        *   Started with more complicated design, which became an issue
        *   Ended up simplifying a lot to avoid making something too difficult to integrate with existing components
        *   I'm expecting to flesh these out more once the audio playback thumbnail has been integrated (Tuan) and I can work on integrating these project management components with the core of our application
    *   Opened a pull request
        *   Merge project management with master
        *   Not strictly necessary, but useful as exercise
    *   Created [Spark User Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uvdGcDdwmmioiQLi-uWVZDDIGqzRN33mTG3bzXqQsGM/edit?userstoinvite=tuanthai401@gmail.com&ts=60a424d7)
    *   Added documentation to `AudioRecorder.h`
    *   Did not address any previously documented issues
*   Plans and goals for following week
    *   Playback thumbnail integration
        *   Aid Tuan in completion
    *   Integrate project management components
        *   Once playback thumbnail is complete
    *   Tie in playback and recording components
        *   This I anticipate being a challenge
        *   I'm hoping the project management components can make this job easier
    *   Update user documentation as necessary
    *   If time permits, look into fixing [issue #2: Audio input silent when multiple inputs are selected](https://github.com/nlstrait/Spark/issues/2)
        *   This is not crucial; one input works just fine 


### Mark Lei

*   Plans and goals from last week

    *   â€¦


### Jay Grinols

*   Plans and goals from last week
    *   Integrate playback component with the main project
    *   Creating a better build process for windows
*   Progress and issues
    *   Testing became a high priority so I spent most of my time on this instead
    *   Getting build process to work using cmake also became somewhat of a priority so I spent a lot of time on this as well
    *   Didn't do much work on integration of playback component as a result
    *   Successfully automated testing on github actions
    *   Successfully rewrote the whole workflow using FRUT with cmake
        *   Documented the mac workflow file as well
*   Plans and goals for following week
    *   Clean up playback thumbnail component
    *   Fully integrate playback thumbnail to work with recording
    *   Fix windows build issue with missing header files on github runner system

### Tuan Thai

*   Plans and goals from last week
    *   Fix the windows build and test suite priority.
    *   Perhaps add more functions (thumbnail) and fix issues.
    *   We still need to reflect and incorporate all issues/feedback.
    *   Need to talk to group about planning ahead.
*   Progress and issues
    *   Wrote documentation for mixdown folder header/cpp files
    *   Wrote documentation for main component header/cpp files
    *   We all cleared up the issues for how we document code
    *   Wrote documentation for main class
    *   Worked on implementing Jay's playback scroller
*   Plans and goals for following week
    *   Finish up Jay's part by end of Thursday and commit so Nolan can start on his part.
    *   Implement the thumbnail
    *   Write more test cases
