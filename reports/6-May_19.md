### Progress and issues

*   Implemented simple project management components (to be integrated)
*   Documentation
    *   Created [Spark User Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uvdGcDdwmmioiQLi-uWVZDDIGqzRN33mTG3bzXqQsGM/edit?userstoinvite=tuanthai401@gmail.com&ts=60a424d7)
    *   Added documentation to header files for several components
    *   Added documentation for building and testing processes
*   Did not close any previously documented issues
*   Got Mark (relatively) up-to-speed
*   ...


### Plans and goals for following week

*   Agenda for Thursday project meeting
    *   Address next week's assignment: Peer Review
        *   We should especially careful this week to keep our master branch clean and building properly, as others will be interacting with it and downloading Spark at unknown times.
    *   We have 12 days until our final release. What is most important for us to focus on?
        *   Playback and recording integration
        *   ...
    *   Address Final Release assignment
    *   Mark: How are you? Where are you? Caught up? Questions?
    *   ...
*   Complete audio playback thumbnail
*   Integrate project management components
*   Integrate playback and recording functionality
    *   Very important to complete prior to final release
    *   Without this, Spark doesn't serve its purpose
*   ...



## Contributions


### Nolan Strait

*   Plans and goals from last week
    *   Implement components for project management
        *   Encapsulate mixdowns and layers in a project
        *   Ease communication between separate components which are both working on projects
        *   Enable easier project management outside of Spark
    *   Improve existing documentation and create new documents with aim of making them as useful and intuitive as possible
    *   Perform code reviews
    *   Addressing existing issues via GitHub Issues
        *   To be specified... 
*   Progress and issues
    *   Implemented project management components
        *   Started with more complicated design, which became an issue
        *   Ended up simplifying a lot to avoid making something too difficult to integrate with existing components
        *   I'm expecting to flesh these out more once the audio playback thumbnail has been integrated (Tuan) and I can work on integrating these project management components with the core of our application
    *   Opened a pull request
        *   Merge project management with master
        *   Not strictly necessary, but useful as exercise
    *   Created [Spark User Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uvdGcDdwmmioiQLi-uWVZDDIGqzRN33mTG3bzXqQsGM/edit?userstoinvite=tuanthai401@gmail.com&ts=60a424d7)
    *   Added documentation to `AudioRecorder.h`
    *   Did not address any previously documented issues
*   Plans and goals for following week
    *   Playback thumbnail integration
        *   Aid Tuan in completion
    *   Integrate project management components
        *   Once playback thumbnail is complete
    *   Tie in playback and recording components
        *   This I anticipate being a challenge
        *   I'm hoping the project management components can make this job easier
    *   Update user documentation as necessary
    *   If time permits, look into fixing [issue #2: Audio input silent when multiple inputs are selected](https://github.com/nlstrait/Spark/issues/2)
        *   This is not crucial; one input works just fine
