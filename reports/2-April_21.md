## Team Report


### Plans and goals from last week

*   Agenda for Thursday project meeting
    *   Is Popsicle viable?
    *   What basic code skeleton do we need before we can effectively split off and do our own work (and/or pair program) on features?
    *   What combination of Python frameworks and tools we will use if Popsicle fails.
*   Learn basics of the framework(s) we will use
*   GUI mockups and general GUI concept/design

### Tuan Thai

*   Plans and goals from last week
    *   Planning on trying to run Popsicle framework on windows machine.
    *   Looking into suitable ways to use JUCE or Python Combinations if Popsicle isn't working.
    *   Learning the basics of our frameworks and tools in order to design and create a mixdown folder.
    *   Should allow access to locale in order to select individual mixdowns.
    *   Start up with the last mixdown folder as the default.
*   Progress and issues
    *   Popsicle is hard to get running on a windows machine.
    *   Popsicle lacks documentation and thus makes it hard to understand the GUI examples.
    *   I assume that Popsicle and JUCE should be linked enough that the GUI examples we chose can follow.
    *   I got Popsicle to work on a linux machine but I don't always have access to said linux machine.
    *   Currently using JUCE to make some GUI mockups and looking into mixdown folders.
    *   May have to offset plans and goals from last week to test out prototypes first.
*   Plans and goals for following week
    *   Create some GUI mockups on JUCE and Python TKinter to compare.
    *   Utilize JUCE and C++ frameworks to create mixdown folder.
    *   Compare previous point to a version created purely from Python sound device and other tools.
    *   Hopefully get a working version of mixdown folder and some semblance of a GUI for it.
