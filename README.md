# Spark: Quick-capture for music producers

## Overview
Creators shouldn't have to open an entire heavy-weight DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) to record new material for existing projects. Spark aims to eliminate friction in the music production process by enabling creators to easily browse through mixdowns and quickly capture inspired additions.

### Termonology
**Mixdown:** an audio file which is a render of some audio project. [Read here](https://backtracks.fm/resources/podcast-dictionary/mixdown+of+audio) for a more in-depth definition.

## Repository Structure
TBD; will likely be highly dependent on our tool(s)/framework(s) of choice. JUCE, for instance, has quite a lot of structure on its own.
