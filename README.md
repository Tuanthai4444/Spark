# Spark: quick-capture for music producers

## Overview
Creators shouldn't have to open an entire heavy-weight DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) to record new material for existing projects. Spark aims to eliminate friction in the music production process by enabling creators to easily browse through mixdowns and quickly capture inspired additions.

### Termonology
**Mixdown:** an audio file which is a render of some audio project. [Read here](https://backtracks.fm/resources/podcast-dictionary/mixdown+of+audio) for a more in-depth definition.

## Repository Structure
We are currently in an experimental phase, so our repository structure has yet to settle. It will ultimately dependent on our tool(s)/framework(s) of choice. 
### `prototypes/`
Here you can find current propotypes. We are using this space to experiment with and decide between two primary toolsets:
1. [JUCE](https://juce.com/) (C++ framework for audio application development, GUI functionality included)
2. [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) (Python GUI toolkit) and [python-sounddevice](https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (Python audio processing library)
